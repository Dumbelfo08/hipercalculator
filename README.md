This helps you calculate operations bigger than powers.

You know that additions are the basic operation, and from there, it's just iterations. Multiplications are iterations of additions, and powers are iterations of multiplications, and that's it?

But, what if we could go one step higher? Or two? Or infinite!?

This are hiperpowers.

Representing a power like 2^3=8 (base ^ exponent = result)

Hiperpowers are represented with a variable number of ^ symbols. That number is the hypermodule.

For example, hypermodule 1 is a normal power, but hypermodule 2 is an iteration of powers.

For example 3^^4 = 3^(3^(3^3))
And this can continue!
3^^^4 = 3^^(3^^(3^^3)) = too big of a number
